# iBooking-Android-App
2021-01-03

iBooking is the Android app developed by our group in this semester. 
According to our research, many XJTLU students complained that it was hard to know which room was available for self-study. Based on the requirements, we designed iBooking which provides students a tool to view latest information of study-room availability and book seats.
